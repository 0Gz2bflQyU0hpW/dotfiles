Make sure conky is installed, and install this PPA:

    sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:teejee2008/ppa
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install conky-manager

Make sure to install "curl" in order to display the weather! (sudo apt-get install curl)

Install this conkyrc:

1. Install the "DroidSans" fonts.
2. Run `/.install_conky.sh` to copy files to .conky dir
3. Replace your own yahoo weather.
    - go to https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/
    - select XML, copy and paste (with your woeid): select * from weather.forecast where woeid = "2151330" and u = "c" , you need to change the text content to your own city.
    - then copy the url to edit in .conkyrc file

4. The first day in the conky displays the forecast for today.(in blue color)
5. Run conky

NOTE*

Be careful when changing fonts as well as font sizes!The images in conky have a set position, so if you change the font or size of the text, the text will move up/down while the images will stay in position, making it look out of place.

If you wish to change the font you can fix the problem in 3 ways:

1. Either change the size of the font until your images are in position

2. Change the position off the corresponding images.Search for "-p" and manipulate the neccesary values.

3. You can also move the text up/down by adding empty lines in the conkyrc.(enter/backspace)
